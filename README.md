# Proposals

This repository contains proposals for distributed systems which copyrights have been assigned as intellectual property of the Delta Foundation, under the Apache Software License v2.0.

This repository makes it easy to innovate in the open by participating in the design of better ideas for distributed systems. Those ideas are then available for all to implement and pursue.

# Contributing to this repository

When you'd like to contribute the idea to DeltaP2P, fork and clone this repository, and offer a pull request under the proposals folder with your content.

* This repository contains a `sample.md` file you can use to format your proposal.
* Try to limit your content to one file. 
* If you have images, please create a subfolder in proposals named after your proposal, and place them there. Relative links resolve in github pages.
